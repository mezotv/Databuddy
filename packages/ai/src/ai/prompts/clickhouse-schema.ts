const GUIDELINES = `## Query Guidelines
- Use client_id = {websiteId:String} to filter by website. Only websiteId is auto-injected as a parameter. For date ranges use now() - INTERVAL N DAY, not custom parameters like {from:DateTime}.
- The primary timestamp column on analytics.events is \`time\`. Avoid aliasing columns as \`time\` in CTEs/subqueries — it conflicts with ClickHouse's built-in time() function. Use \`ts\`, \`event_time\`, or \`event_ts\` as aliases instead.
- Use toStartOfDay(), toStartOfHour() for time grouping.
- Geographic data (country, region, city) exists only on analytics.events, NOT on web_vitals_spans or error_spans. Join via session_id if needed.
- All timestamps are in UTC.
- analytics.custom_events.properties contains JSON strings — use JSONExtractString(properties, 'key') to parse.
- Identity: \`anonymous_id\` is a per-device id; \`profile_id\` is the customer-assigned user id ('' when anonymous, on analytics.events, analytics.custom_events, and analytics.revenue). To count people, dedupe identified users across devices with \`uniq(${EVENTS_VISITOR_KEY})\`; on custom_events/revenue use \`uniq(${CUSTOM_EVENTS_VISITOR_KEY})\` because anonymous_id is Nullable and rows missing both identifiers must not count as a person. To count only identified users: \`uniqIf(profile_id, profile_id != '')\`. error_spans/web_vitals_spans/outgoing_links have no profile_id — resolve an identified user's rows there via their anonymous_ids from analytics.events.

## Aggregate function preferences
- Percentiles: use \`quantileTDigest(p)(col)\` for p50/p75/p95/p99. Plain \`quantile(p)\` uses reservoir sampling and is noisy at the tails (~10% error at p99). \`quantileTDigest\` is within 0.1% of exact at the same memory cost.
- Distinct counts: \`uniq(col)\` (HLL11) is fine when approximate is OK. Prefer \`uniqCombined64(col)\` for high-cardinality distinct counts (visitor_id, session_id, anonymous_id, path) — same ~0.3% error as uniq() but lower memory and stable across reruns. Reserve \`uniqExact(col)\` only when an exact count is genuinely required (small cardinality dashboard widgets, billing).
- Top-N lists: prefer exact \`GROUP BY ... ORDER BY count() DESC LIMIT N\` for user-facing leaderboards. \`topK(N)(col)\` is approximate and can swap the bottom-of-list entries — only use it for ML/agent summarization where minor ordering noise is acceptable.

## ClickHouse Pitfalls
- NO nested aggregates: \`sum(count())\` is illegal. Use a subquery: \`SELECT sum(cnt) FROM (SELECT count() as cnt ... GROUP BY ...)\`
- NO aggregates in WHERE: use HAVING for post-aggregation filters, not WHERE.
- \`is_bounce\` is NOT a column. Compute bounces as sessions with exactly 1 pageview: \`SELECT session_id, count() as pv FROM analytics.events ... GROUP BY session_id HAVING pv = 1\`
- \`website_id\` is NOT the tenant column on \`analytics.events\`. Use \`client_id = {websiteId:String}\`.
- \`created_at\` is NOT the canonical event timestamp. Use \`time\` on \`analytics.events\`.
- \`page_path\` does NOT exist. The column is \`path\`.
- \`event_type\` does NOT exist. The column is \`event_name\`.
- Performance timing columns (\`load_time\`, \`ttfb\`, \`dom_ready_time\`, \`render_time\`) do NOT exist on analytics.events. Page performance lives in analytics.web_vitals_spans as metric_name/metric_value rows.
- \`properties\` on analytics.events is always empty. Custom event properties live in analytics.custom_events — use the custom_events_* builders.
- Pageviews are \`event_name = 'screen_view'\`. Never use \`event_name = 'pageview'\`.
- \`device_type\` is often empty. Always handle: \`NULLIF(device_type, '') as device_type\` or \`if(device_type = '', 'Desktop', device_type)\`
- For IN filters use tuple syntax: \`path IN ('/pricing', '/docs', '/demo')\`, NOT array syntax \`['/pricing', '/docs']\`
- formatDateTime does NOT support %A (weekday name). Use \`toDayOfWeek(time)\` (1=Mon, 7=Sun) or \`dateName('weekday', time)\`
- web_vitals_spans has NO device_type, country, or referrer columns. Join to analytics.events via session_id to get those.`;
