## Events (overage on Hobby & Pro)

Overage = events **above** the monthly included amount. Cumulative overage is charged in bands (first band fills, then the next). Hobby and Pro share the same tier rates.

| Cumulative overage (events) | $ / event | $ / 1,000 events |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st – 2,000,000 | $0.000035 | $0.035 |
| 2,000,001 – 10,000,000 | $0.00003 | $0.03 |
| 10,000,001 – 50,000,000 | $0.00002 | $0.02 |
| 50,000,001 – 250,000,000 | $0.000015 | $0.015 |
| 250,000,001+ | $0.00001 | $0.01 |

### Example monthly totals (USD, illustrative)

- **Hobby**, 500,000 events: 470,000 overage in band 1 → ~$10 + (470,000 × $0.000035) ≈ **$26.45/mo**.
- **Pro**, 5,000,000 events: 4,000,000 overage → band 1 + band 2 → ~$50 + $70 + $60 = **$180/mo**.

## Investigation credits

Every cloud plan includes Investigation credits for Databunny questions and investigations. Credits pay for the work Databunny performs, not a fixed number of messages: simple checks use fewer credits, while deeper investigations, replies, and rechecks use more. Hobby and Pro also receive a daily credit bonus that replenishes each day.

## Enterprise

Custom contracts for volume, compliance, onboarding, and support. Use [databuddy.cc/pricing](https://www.databuddy.cc/pricing) or your account contact.

## Definitions

- **Event:** A pageview, custom event, captured error, or Web Vital measurement counted toward monthly analytics usage. Feature flag evaluations and uptime checks do not count.
- **Investigation credits:** Credits that pay for Databunny's work. Simple checks use fewer credits; deeper investigations, replies, and rechecks use more.
- **Overage:** Events in a billing month above the plan’s included events.
