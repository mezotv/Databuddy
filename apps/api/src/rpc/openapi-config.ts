**Authentication:** Endpoints accept either session cookies (browser) or an API key. For programmatic access, use an API key.

**API Key usage:**
- Send in the \`x-api-key\` header, or
- Send as a Bearer token in the \`Authorization\` header: \`Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>\`
- API keys must be scoped to an organization. Create keys in the dashboard under Organization -> API Keys.

**Scope requirements:** Some endpoints require specific API key scopes. Check each operation's \`x-required-scopes\` for requirements. Session authentication does not use scopes; access is determined by organization membership and role.

**Available scopes:** ${AVAILABLE_API_SCOPES}`;

export const API_KEY_DESCRIPTION = `API key for programmatic access. Use instead of session cookies when calling from servers, scripts, or external integrations.

**How to send:**
- \`x-api-key: <your-api-key>\` header (preferred), or
- \`Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>\` header

**Scope requirements:** Session auth uses organization membership and roles; no scopes. API key auth may require scopes. Operations that require scopes include \`x-required-scopes\` in their schema.

**Available scopes:** ${AVAILABLE_API_SCOPES}

**Creating keys:** Keys are created in the dashboard (Organization -> API Keys) and must be scoped to an organization. Store the secret securely; it is shown only once.`;
